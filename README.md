# Data-Mining-Project-2
Knowledge Disc. & Data Mining
Course number: CAP 4770

This project was created for the purpose of testing and implementing various data mining algorithms while
plotting the results from the given CSV file. The CSV file provided by the class is about rotten tomato reviews and
our group had to filter each review from their ratings of high, medium, and low.
Once the CSV was properly filtered and loaded into the spyder IDE then our group proceeded to implement
the various types of algorithms provided by sklearn which were Decision Tree, K-NN, Keras, and Naive Bayes.
After the aglorithms were implemented the results of the validations and training validations between each individual
word within the reviews were graphed.
